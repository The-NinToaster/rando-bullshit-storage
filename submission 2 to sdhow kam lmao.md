From the beginning the society has taken measures to be as inclusive as possible while also remanining humorous and open enough to allow for good amounts of self expression. 
That being said, there *can* be things that may filter out people from partaking in our activities, but most of these remain largely out of the society's control. 
However, we can still try to mitigate the following issues: 

### 1. Female, trans, genderqueer and gender non-conforming students may feel left out.

Now, this is *largely* a problem of optics of the entire field, alas, the society has always strived to ensure equal opportunity and values of any people that join us. 
I, myself, happen to intersect quite a bit already, being a gender-non-conforming woman, middle eastern raised mexican, with severe mental illness and some neurological disability (thank you brain damage, very cool!)
in a STEM field, let alone president of the society. I understand how weird it feels to kind of stick out. For much of this, the society can have an open space and ensure we catch as much 
no bueno things and strive for very open disucssion of topics as much as possible, as well as getting ourselves out there and showing that such people can be welcome. Since our society membership is 
very much opt-in, it suffers from self-selection bias, and for that, we can't do much to mitigate other than to be very vocal about being welcoming and try to convince more people that STEM fields can be welcoming, revolutionary fields
for people like me and other marginalized people to come in if they choose to do so. 

### 2. Someone says something super cringe in the lounge or is super disrecpectful (this covers two issues)

I am no stranger to the geopolitical discussions of the society lounge. I quite enjoy partaking in those. And of course, I am no stranger to the odd hot take every now and then. 
Now, the hot take problem to me is kind of a ticking time bomb. Censoring such types of discussions, specially about current events and how to solve them will do no good for the society and the field
since we seek to solve problems, not avoid them; of course, allowing such discussions leads to the odd hot take or two or five. For this, we usually mitigate this in the form of the good old 
"really, this is the hill you're dying on?" technique. I am of the belief that everyone inevitably will have such hot takes. Our society can't be a squeaky clean safe space because part of 
our mission is to try to introduce discussion and solve issues, and inevitably, painful conversations will show up. For this, we usually have open dialougue and debate, tackling the problem 
and deconstructing the cringe and hot take one point at a time. Not only does this help us practice how to tackle such problems, but it also lets the other person learn. 

However, this is of course, not apologia for someone coming in and bad faith saying cringe stuff all the time. If we do notice that someone is not open for discussion and is not willing to rexamine
their views on things through dialogue and teaching, they will be asked to leave, and potentially even reported. Our society is a space of learning and dialogue. As much as we encourage people to try to tackle the odd hot take
here and there with a teachable moment, we do have lines we will draw, and some things will not be tolerated. 

For example, 

If someone agrees with the Jordan Peterson attage that diversity and inclusion are cringe and bad because it can be racist, we will engage in dialogue as its a relevant topic of discussion 
in our field and also a problem we have to face. 

If the person then decides to be openly sexist, we ask them to basically stop being that cringe and that they're on thin ice. 

If the person decides to triple down and become an asshole, we not only ask him to leave, and disucss potentially kicking him out, we will also report them for harrasment. 

Now, I know there will be this criticism inevitably regarding this approach, so I'm going to take some time to address it: 

Yes, I am aware some people may take this approach as a very defensive one. "Nikki, we can't be cosntantly defending our right to live and exist" and "We shouldn't have to". 
I agree! 100%! Man I wish I didn't have to do it as well. However, society isn't there yet. But, I want anyone with this criticism to put this into perspective: 

You don't have to and are not obligated to face and fight members or students who are assholes or refuse to understand the point. We have had this issue in past years while I was a member, and usually two things would happen: 
Either the people who knew better would stand up and be like "okay, wtf, this was super cringe" or the executives would hear about it and deal with it appropiately. 

Now, I have been faced with the "why isn't this a zero-tolerance thing!" and I have an answer to that, though its much more of a personal take and this can only be applied so much. 

As as a member of quite a bunch of minorities, I have been no stranger whatsoever to having to defend and even fight my way to live. I however, believe a lot of this opression is largely 
a product of ignorance rather than bigotry. Nature vs Nurture kind of thing. I believe there is value in trying to open dialogue and discuss with people about how their values 
might be awful and oppresive. As future Computer Scientists and Engineers, we should strive to tackle social problems as well as technical problems, and there's real value to be gained 
in deconstructing arguments and getting someone out of the frankly dumb way of thinking that may have been all they knew and raised in. I whole-heartedly believe these people shouldn't thrown out with the bath water. 

That being said, I do understand there comes a point where it stops being of value to continue to engage, and I do understand there are limits over what is worthy of trying to change their mind over and what is non-negotiable. 

### 3. Disability Friendly

Yeah, this is one is definitely something we need a lot more work in, not only as a society but also as a university. As much as we have certain measures to ensure as many people can attend our events, 
we can't always predict what kind of extra needs someone may need. For this we plan to run surveys before major events asking for any accesibility needs we should cover for those attending. 
As for everyday lounge use, the department offers quiet study zones and our builings have elevators. Any other specific needs that we as a society can't cover will need to be brought up to Student Union or
the Department.


>Thinking about how to avoid these scenarios from the beginning is key. For each of the examples above, provide a brief explanation about how you'll avoid them happening.
>Designing for your community's needs
>Needs facilitated

>What needs are you going to make efforts to facilitate? How will you facilitate them?

Any needs that we, meaning the society, student union, the department or the university can offer to make a space more inclusive will be added to the best of our ability

The society provides snacks and orders food trying our best to be respectful and mindful of allergies and diseases or autoimmune disorders such as celiac, spaces to safely dispose biohazards such as needles, we are a non-smoking zone and offer quiet spaces to work. The University and Student Union separately
offer similar services as well as a psychology centre, a counselling centre, access to health care services and accesibility services and UPEI Security.  

>Needs not facilitated

>What needs won't you be able to facilitate? Why is this?

We cannot and are unable to specify what we can't cover as it'll vary based on what the university can offer us. This can vary depending on funding, administration, etc. 
We will try our best to faciliate as many needs as we feasibly can.
